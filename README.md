HTML Structure: We have a container for the carousel with a carousel-inner containing the product slides. Navigation buttons (prev-btn and next-btn) are added for manual navigation.

CSS Styling: The CSS provides styling for the carousel, product slides, and navigation buttons. It includes a responsive layout using flexbox.

JavaScript: The script handles manual navigation when clicking on the navigation buttons and enables automatic rotation every 5 seconds (adjustable) using setInterval.
